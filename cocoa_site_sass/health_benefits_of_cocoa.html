<h2>Health Benefits of Cocoa</h2>
<p>Cocoa, used throughout history as a folk medicine, may <em>actually</em> have significant health benefits, according to a new study by Harvard researchers.</p>

<p>Their analysis of 21 studies with 2,575 participants shows that cocoa consumption is associated with decreased blood pressure, improved blood vessel health, and improvement in cholesterol levels, among other benefits.</p>

<p>Eric L. Ding, PhD, of Harvard Medical School says the apparent health benefits come from <strong>polyphenolic flavonoids</strong> in cocoa that have the potential to prevent heart disease. Flavonoids are antioxidants that are commonly found in fruits, vegetables, tea, wine, and coffee.</p>

<p class="bluebold">In addition to decreasing blood pressure and improving blood vessel health, consumption of flavonoid-rich cocoa decreased “bad” LDL cholesterol among people under age 50, and increased good HDL cholesterol, the analysis showed.</p>

<p>Flavonoid-rich cocoa consumption also was linked to reductions in risk factors for diabetes -- a major risk factor itself for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Also, resistance to the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar, favorably dropped among people who consumed flavonoid-rich cocoa, compared to people in comparison groups.</p>

<p>Further, consumption of flavonoid-rich cocoa did not change triglyceride levels of study participants or make them obese. Triglycerides are a type of blood fat that have been linked to coronary artery disease when levels are elevated above normal.</p>

<h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">Possibly Effective for:</h4>
<p>Heart disease. Some research shows that eating cocoa lowers the chance of heart disease and death. Cocoa might have this effect by lowering blood pressure and improving blood vessels function.</p>
<p>High blood pressure. Most research shows that eating dark chocolate or cocoa products for 2-8 weeks can lower the top number in a blood pressure reading (systolic blood pressure) by 4 mmHg. The bottom number (diastolic blood pressure) is also lowered by 2 mmHg in people with high blood pressure.</p>
