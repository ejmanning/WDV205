<ul>
	<li>Specificity - The rules given to certain elements don't always apply, due to the different weight of selectors. For example, an id has more weight than a class, therefore "overpowers." </li>
	<li>Precedence - The rule of precedence applies when there are two opposing rules applying to an element. The rule says that the one listed closer to the end of the stylesheet will apply.</li>
	<li>Inheritance - The rule of inheritance states that a property will inherit its value from a parent element. </li>
	<li>Property - A property is the thing that specifies what to style. For example, color, line-height, font size, etc. are all properties.</li>
	<li>Value - A value goes with a property and gives the element the style. For example, blue is a value to go with the property, color.</li>
	<li>Selector - The selector selects the part of the page you want to style. For example, h1 can be a selector.</li>
</ul>
